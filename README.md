## Design for unknowns.
Open Schema provides common expectations beween designers who write apps using the open schema standard. 
## Inspired by.
This project was inspired by Schema.org and Google's Structured Data (rich results). These projects create a communication interface between designers and robots that helps robots understand designer's webpages. They are what inspired the idea for a common schema that creates an interface between applications, both current and future.

## Interfaces everywhere.
It's true that there are all types of standards, protocols and programming languages in the computer science industry. These are interfaces to computers, not between projects. The final implemention, the underlying details are unique for each project. It's also true that large corporations have developed detailed api's for their applications. And these api's are designed to make it easy for the world to interact with them. But make no mistake, providing easy access to these applications is in no way charitable.

## An analogy.
It used to be that mobile phone companies manufactured unique chargers for their products. In some cases they were able to charge more than $40 for a charger which seemed rediculous. The European Union now requires usb-c chargers for all mobile devices. (As a side note: we aren't advocating for government regulation it's just simply an analogy of a ubiquitous interface.) The EU's regulations was, "...also intended to eliminate technological "lock-in" that keeps users tied to one manufacturer's proprietary formats." per Engadget's article: https://www.engadget.com/eu-usb-c-port-charging-requirement-approved-141546579.html?guccounter=1

## Elimate technological "lock-in"
It is our goal to provide an open standard that describes a common schema for programs. It is our abition to describe both nouns (objects) and verbs (actions). We are beginning with what is closest to our heart, content for news sites, ecommerce and advertising. We are open to the development of all subjects from the wider commuunity.
